# Numerical simulation of transitions between quantum states of an atom.
The main components of this simulation program were developed as a master thesis in the working group of Professor Pohl 
at the University of Mainz. One project of the group aims at decelerating Lithium atoms using a Zeeman slower and 
catch the slowed atoms in a magneto-optical trap (MOT). Therefor, the atom species, simulation parameters and experiental 
setup used in this repository as an example are those of the Lithium experiment.

## Getting Started

Using the setup files in the example folder you can run
'''
python main.py
'''
and get simulation results (log file, plots) in a result folder.

## Prerequisites

Python 3 has to be installed to use the simulation. All python package prerequisites are listed in the requirements.txt.
